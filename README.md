# Heuristic optimization in autonomous driving
This repository contains the implementation of two metaheuristic algorithms developed to optimize an autonomous driving algorithm with the aim of reducing the travel time of a competition circuit.

One of the heuristic algorithms is based on local search engines and taboo lists for optimization. The other heuristics implements a standard genetic algorithm.

Both algorithms are developed in C and run under the Webots simulation environment. Webots provides the simulation engine of the vehicle, the circuit and all the physics.
